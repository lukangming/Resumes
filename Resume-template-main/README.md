# Resume template
A resume template written in typst, designed for zh_CN.

## How to use
Create a project on [typst.app](https://typst.app/), then copy and paste everything in `main.typ`, `template.typ` and `icons.typ`, and all done!

Online [preview](https://typst.app/project/rOKiFS0kMTLBWEmtIVLckq). (The first compilation may be a bit slow, but afterwards it will be an incremental compilation where you see the results immediately.）
